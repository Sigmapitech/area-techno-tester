# Security Audit Report

This audit reviews a stack including **React/React Flow (UI), FastAPI (Python backend), OAuth, PostgreSQL/SQLAlchemy (DB), Redis (cache),** and **CapacitorJS (mobile).**
We examine common web risks (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.) and recommend mitigations for each layer.

## Frontend (React & React Flow)
1. **Safe JSX Rendering**  
   React’s JSX rendering engine automatically escapes content, meaning script tags and injected code are rendered as harmless strings. This makes ordinary JSX safe from script injection.  
   [source](https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/react-xss-guide-examples-and-prevention/#:~:text=React%20outputs%20elements%20and%20data,render%20it%20as%20a%20string)

2. **Avoid Dangerous APIs**  
   Using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or direct DOM manipulation reintroduces XSS risk. Never use these with untrusted data. If raw HTML must be inserted, sanitize or escape it first.

3. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**  
   Enforce strong CSP headers to block inline scripts, unsafe eval, and unauthorized external script sources. This reduces the blast radius of potential XSS exploits.  
   [source](https://dev.to/ceblakely/web-security-for-developers-cross-site-scripting-xss-1hh9#:~:text=,CSP)

4. **Dependency Hygiene**  
   Regularly audit dependencies with tools like `npm audit`, lock versions, and update libraries promptly. Avoid using eval-like functions that can open execution vectors for attackers.

5. **React Flow Usage**  
   React Flow (graph/flow UI library) currently has no reported vulnerabilities.
   However, treat it like any other UI library: never pass untrusted, user-controlled text directly into its renderers without proper sanitization. Keep React Flow and all npm packages up to date to minimize supply-chain attack risks.  
  [source](https://security.snyk.io/package/npm/react-flow-renderer#:~:text=Direct%20Vulnerabilities)

## Authentication & OAuth
1. **State Parameter for CSRF Protection**  
   Always include and validate a unique, random `state` parameter in OAuth redirects. This prevents CSRF attacks by ensuring the request and response belong to the same session.  
   [source](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/attack-protection/state-parameters#:~:text=CSRF%20attacks)

2. **PKCE for Mobile & Native Clients**  
   For mobile or native apps (e.g., Capacitor), use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) during the OAuth flow. This ensures authorization codes cannot be intercepted or reused by malicious apps.  
   [source](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/security#:~:text=This%20is%20especially%20important%20for,for%20oAuth2%20in%20Capacitor%20apps)

3. **Redirect URI Validation**  
   Strictly validate redirect URIs—no wildcards. This prevents open redirect vulnerabilities and stops tokens from leaking to untrusted endpoints.

4. **Cookie Security Settings**  
   For web sessions, secure cookies with the `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Lax` (or stricter) attributes. This blocks access from JavaScript and reduces CSRF/hijacking risk.  
   [source](https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/react-csrf-protection-guide-examples-and-how-to-enable-it/#:~:text=match%20at%20L1926%20The%20sameSite%3A,depth)

5. **Secure Token Storage**  
   Never store tokens in localStorage or sessionStorage (exposed to JavaScript). Instead, use secure OS-provided storage mechanisms such as iOS Keychain or Android Keystore.  
   [source](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/resources/best-practices#:~:text=Handle%20user%20tokens%20securely)

6. **Token Scope & Lifespan Management**  
   Minimize risk by keeping tokens short-lived and narrowly scoped. Use rotating refresh tokens to further reduce exposure if a token is compromised.

## API Backend (FastAPI & Secure API Design)
1. **HTTPS Enforcement**  
   Always serve the API over HTTPS (e.g., configure Uvicorn with TLS certs or run behind Nginx with SSL). This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures encrypted communication.
   [source](https://escape.tech/blog/how-to-secure-fastapi-api/#:~:text=First%20step%3A%20Use%20HTTPS%20for,secure%20communication)

2. **Input Validation & Sanitization**  
   Use Pydantic models for all request payloads to enforce type checks, field constraints, and validation rules. This blocks malformed or malicious input and helps prevent injection attacks. Never interpolate raw user data into SQL queries, HTML, or command execution.
   [source](https://escape.tech/blog/how-to-secure-fastapi-api/#:~:text=Validate%20and%20sanitize%20user%20input)

3. **CORS Policy Control**  
   Restrict CORS to trusted frontend origins and required HTTP methods only. Avoid `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` if credentials or sensitive APIs are in use.

4. **Authentication & Token Verification**  
   Use FastAPI’s OAuth2/token utilities but always validate tokens server-side—check signatures, expiration times, and scopes. Reject invalid or tampered tokens.

5. **Cookie Security**  
   If cookies are issued, apply `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` attributes (as in the frontend guidelines) to prevent CSRF and theft.

6. **Rate Limiting & Throttling**  
   Implement rate-limiting (e.g., per-IP or per-user) to mitigate brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and DoS attempts.

7. **Security Headers**  
   Add protective headers such as CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options in API responses to reduce common attack surfaces.

8. **Error Handling Discipline** 
   Do not expose stack traces or framework details to clients. Return generic error messages while logging technical details internally.

9. **Logging & Auditing**  
   Record failed authentication attempts, suspicious input patterns, and unusual request behaviors. Use logs for monitoring, auditing, and incident response.

## Database & ORM (PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy)
1. **Parameterized Queries by Default**  
   Always use parameterized queries or ORM methods. SQLAlchemy and drivers like psycopg2 automatically escape values, preventing SQL injection. Never concatenate user input into SQL strings.
   [source](https://realpython.com/prevent-python-sql-injection/#:~:text=think%20about%20when%20trying%20to,compose%20a%20query%20with%20parameters)

2. **Safe ORM & Raw SQL Usage**  
   Within SQLAlchemy, prefer expressions like `filter(Model.foo == user_input)` instead of string interpolation.
   If raw SQL is unavoidable (e.g., `text()`), bind values with parameters (`:param`) instead of f-strings. Avoid user-controlled table/column names.
   [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6501583/sqlalchemy-sql-injection#:~:text=The%20accepted%20answer%20is%20lazy,you%20are%20open%20to%20attack)

3. **Principle of Least Privilege**  
   Configure a dedicated database role for the application with minimal permissions (e.g., no `SUPERUSER`, `CREATE`, or `ALTER` unless strictly required). Limit access to only the necessary schemas and tables.

4. **Database Network Security**  
   Run PostgreSQL on an internal network and block public exposure of port `5432`. If remote access is needed, require SSL/TLS and firewall rules to restrict connections to trusted hosts only.

5. **Advanced Access Controls**  
   For multi-tenant systems, consider PostgreSQL’s row-level security (RLS) or built-in authentication features to enforce per-user or per-tenant isolation at the database layer.

6. **Maintenance & Backups**  
   Keep PostgreSQL updated with security patches, and implement regular automated backups to protect against data loss or corruption.

## In-Memory Cache (Redis)
1. **Authentication & Access Control**  
   By default, Redis has no authentication and is open to all interfaces. Always configure authentication—use `requirepass` for Redis <6 or ACLs for Redis ≥6. This ensures only authorized clients can connect.
   [source](https://medium.com/@rizqimulkisrc/redis-security-preventing-unauthorized-access-and-data-leakage-46278d4f2bb3#:~:text=No%20Authentication%20by%20Default)

2. **Network Binding & Isolation**  
   Restrict Redis to trusted networks by binding it to `127.0.0.1` or a private/internal IP in `redis.conf`. Block public exposure of the Redis port (`6379`) with firewall rules.
   [source](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/#:~:text=In%20this%20case%2C%20the%20web,browsers%20accessing%20the%20web%20application)

3. **TLS Encryption for Traffic**  
   If Redis traffic crosses an untrusted or external network, enable TLS. This prevents attackers from sniffing or tampering with sensitive cache data in transit.

4. **Restrict Dangerous Commands**  
   Disable or rename risky commands such as `FLUSHALL`, `CONFIG`, or `DEBUG`. Alternatively, enforce ACLs to limit which clients can execute them.

5. **Data Sensitivity Awareness**  
   Treat Redis as a cache or ephemeral store, not a secure database. Do not store plaintext sensitive information (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers). Keep sensitive session or token data accessible only through the backend API layer.

## Mobile App (CapacitorJS)
1. **Avoid Hardcoded Secrets**  
   Never embed API keys or secrets in the app binary or JavaScript. Mobile apps can be reverse-engineered, exposing these values. Instead, delegate sensitive operations to a secure backend.
   [source](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/security#:~:text=Avoid%20Embedding%20Secrets%20in%20Code)

2. **Secure Token Storage**  
   Store authentication tokens only in secure, encrypted storage such as iOS Keychain or Android Keystore (or a secure plugin). Never use plain WebView localStorage or sessionStorage.
   [source](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/resources/best-practices#:~:text=Handle%20user%20tokens%20securely)

3. **Safe OAuth & Deep Linking**  
   For mobile logins, use PKCE to protect OAuth flows and prefer platform-provided “universal links” (iOS/Android) over custom URL schemes. This prevents deep-link hijacking.
   [source](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/security#:~:text=This%20is%20especially%20important%20for,for%20oAuth2%20in%20Capacitor%20apps)

4. **Transport Security**  
   Require HTTPS for all network requests. Consider certificate pinning to reduce the risk of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

5. **WebView & Content Security**  
   Apply a strict Content-Security-Policy (CSP) to any remote content. Disable `allowingUnsafeMixedContent` to prevent insecure resource loading inside the app.

6. **App Hardening & Build Security**  
   For Android builds, disable debugging and enable code obfuscation/minification (e.g., ProGuard/R8). Always validate inputs from plugins, and keep Capacitor plus all plugins up to date. Remove unused plugins to minimize attack surface.

# Summary of Critical Risks
Across all layers, **the highest-risk issues** are those that allow code or query injection and unauthorized access.
For example, XSS in React could expose user tokens;
SQL injection in the API could corrupt or expose your database;
CSRF in auth flows could hijack user actions;
leaving Redis open could let attackers flush or steal cached data;
and storing OAuth tokens insecurely on the client could lead to account compromise.

Each of the above sections identifies mitigations - in summary:
- **Sanitize and Validate Everything:** Use built-in frameworks (React auto-escaping, FastAPI/Pydantic validation) and parameterized queries.

- **Lock Down Infrastructure:** Require passwords for Redis, restrict DB access.
  Follow principle of least privilege everywhere.
