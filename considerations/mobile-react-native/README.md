# Consideration for React Native

## Overview

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is a framework developed by Meta that lets developers
build mobile apps using **React** and **JavaScript/TypeScript**. It compiles to native components,
so apps look and feel close to native while still using a single codebase
for both **Android** and **iOS**.

## Why we considered it?

Since our team already has strong knowledge of React and TypeScript,
React Native feels like a natural extension.
It reuses concepts we already know (components, props, hooks, state management),
which means less time learning from scratch and more time actually building features.

## Who in the group has prior knowledge about this tech?

Julien have baseline experience with React Native, and almost everyone in
the group has solid knowledge of React and TypeScript, which makes the transition easier.

## How could this tech allow us to improve our workflow?

* One codebase for both Android and iOS saves time and effort.
* We can leverage our existing React and TypeScript knowledge.
* Large ecosystem of libraries and community support makes adding features straightforward.
* Hot reload and fast refresh speed up prototyping compared to heavier native solutions.

## What is the general feeling?

The general feeling is positive. React Native is lighter to work with than Android
Studio/Kotlin and more approachable thanks to our existing React/TypeScript background.
While it sometimes requires fiddling with native modules for advanced features,
the ease of getting started and building cross-platform apps outweighs the downsides.

## Advantages

* Cross-platform (Android and iOS) with a single codebase.
* Very familiar to the team due to React/TypeScript background.
* Large ecosystem and community support.
* Fast development cycle with hot reload/fast refresh.
* Easier to set up and lighter compared to Android Studio.

## Disadvantages

* Sometimes needs native code/config for advanced device features.
* Performance is not as high as fully native apps (though usually good enough).
* Debugging can occasionally be trickier than in pure web React.

## Use Cases

* Cross-platform mobile apps with shared business logic.
* Apps where speed of development and code reusability are priorities.
* Projects where the team already knows React/TypeScript (like ours).

## Conclusion

React Native fits our team well: it aligns with our existing knowledge,
allows us to develop for both Android and iOS, and avoids the heaviness of Android Studio.
While not as fast as fully native development, its balance of productivity, flexibility,
and cross-platform reach makes it a strong choice for our needs.
