# Consideration for Express.js

## Overview
[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web
application framework that provides a robust set of features for
web and mobile applications. It is one of the most popular choices
for building APIs and server-side applications with JavaScript.

## Why we considered it?
Express.js is widely adopted, easy to set up, and integrates well
with modern front-end frameworks and databases.
It is a proven solution for quickly developing reliable server-side applications.

## Who in the group has prior knowledge about this tech?
Louis and Gabiel have prior experience in Express.js, making learning easier for the group.

## How could this tech allow us to improve our area workflow?
- Enables fast function prototyping and API development with minimal setup.
- Its middleware system simplifies server-side logic, authentication, and error handling.
- Offers seamless integration with JavaScript tools, databases, and services, reducing friction in connecting systems.
- Using JavaScript promotes code reusability across front-end and back-end, streamlining full-stack development.

## What is General feeling? (installation, tools, libs & support)
The general sentiment is positive: installation is straightforward,
the tooling ecosystem is mature, and a wide range of middleware and
libraries are available. Community support is strong,
and most issues can be quickly resolved with existing resources.

## Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Provides a lightweight structure, easy to learn and use.
- **Middleware support**: Rich ecosystem of middleware to extend functionality.
- **Community**: Large, active community with extensive resources and documentation.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with databases, front-end frameworks, and third-party libraries.

## Disadvantages
- **Minimalism**: Being unopinionated means more setup and boilerplate compared to full frameworks.
- **Scalability**: Requires additional structure and conventions to handle large-scale applications.
- **Callback hell**: Although mitigated by promises/async-await, improper use can lead to complex code.

## Use Cases
- REST/CRUD APIs
- backend services

## Conclusion
Express.js is a solid choice for flexibility, speed, and simplicity.
However, for a large project, we may need to add other frameworks to
maintain scalability and manageability.
