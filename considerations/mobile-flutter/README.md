# Consideration for Flutter

## Overview
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. It allows developers to build compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter is designed for fast development with expressive and flexible UI components.

## Why we considered it?
We considered Flutter due to its ability to provide a mobile application. It is also relatively easy to learn and well documented.
Additionally, it can also provide an applicattion web or one adapted to linux, windows or mac; making it versatile in usage.

## Who in the group had prior knowledge about this tech?
Only Julien had a bit of knowledge about this technology, meaning it required for almost everyone to learn it from scratch.

## How could this tech allow us to improve our area workflow ?
- Enable us to have an easy to make mobile application.
- Allow the creator to make an application suitable for any laptop/web platform.
- Provide natural support for some commons IDEs, with a decent amount of options and the ability to run the application in an emulator directly throught said IDE.

## What is General Feeling? (installations, tools, libs & support)
Overall, the experience was pretty midling. The installation went really poorly. While the code documentation is well-made, the installations tutorials are very bad and don't take into account some factors.

## Advantages
- Can be used for both Ios and Android.
- Rich Widget libraries.
- Potentially amazing UI

## Disadvantages
- The installation can be somewhat hard, especially when taking into account what is needed to emulate a mobile application.
- Very limited prior experience, so high learning curve
- Limited access to certain API, requiring us to write platform-specific code.

## Use Cases
- Mobile&Desktop apps.
- Apps that require Custom Designs

## Conclusion
Despite its good traits, flutter doesn't fit the needs of our group. The learning curve and the difficulty of installation really outweight the potential that Flutter has for mobile applications. It, as such, isn't fit for us.
